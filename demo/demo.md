# Interruption

Auro supports two interruptive components - `auro-dialog` and `auro-drawer`. Both are intrusive interactive components, not passive. The components are best used when there is a requirement the user be made aware of the content being shown, moving focus from the main content to the dialog content.

Both components also support a modal (blocking) state where the user must interact with the content of the component in order to continue. Passive dismissal of the content is not allowed. Users of this state must add a trigger for the user to move beyond this content.

Auro holds the opinions of the [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/modal-nonmodal-dialog/) on dialog and modal use to be true.

## Component use cases

The `auro-dialog` and `auro-drawer` components should be used in situations where users may:

* Be prompted to take an action before doing anything else or going back
* Be prompted to view content with the option of closing it

## Dialog example
